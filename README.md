For Bayesian Optimization project, use:

```
python main_EI.py 
```
to check the result. You need to install 'gpytorch' to run the code. 

Please run the code in GPU server, since the data are located there.

I implemented the iterative reconstruction solvers for under-sampled k-space recon, in 
```
/bayesOpt/sample_loss/recon_loss function
```
